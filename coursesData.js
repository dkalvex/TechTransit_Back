We often form close, caring relationships over time with our patients and this can put us at risk for compassion fatigue.</p><p>Working as a caring professional can bring deep satisfaction and lasting rewards. For many practitioners, it brings strong and deep fulfillment to be able to help others, especially those who are experiencing or recovering from a traumatic illness, injury, or event. A feeling of reward and satisfaction comes from knowing we made a difference in someoneâ€™s life. However, that deep caring can have a negative impact on the practitioner, creating chaos, illness and dissatisfaction, in life.</p><p>The focus of this class is to help the practitioner better understand the potential downsides of this work, to identify and develop the tools to manage the demandsâ€”both physically and emotionallyâ€”of work, and minimize the risk of the downsides.</p><p>Through information and worksheets, this class will share effective ways to prevent, or to manage, compassion fatigue and burnout.</p><p><br/></p><p>Compassion Fatigue Outline</p><p>1.\tIntroduction                                                                                          a.\tDefinitions                                                                                                     i.\tComparison compassion fatigue vs burnout                                                 b.\tGeneral review of risk populations                                                    c.\tCauses                                                                                                   2.\tAre you at risk                                                                                      a.\tStatistics                                                                                               b.\tHow to assess for risk                                                                         c.\tIndividuals risk level                                                                            d.\tRisk assessmentâ€”activity                                                                   e.\tSigns &amp; symptoms                                                                                f.\tSigns &amp; symptoms assessment-activity                                                   g.\tReasons to neglect self-care                                                                 3.\tSelf-Assessment                                                                                   a.\tCore needs that contribute                                                                  b.\tBeliefs that contribute                                                                        c.\tDysfunctional beliefs assessmentâ€”activity                                            d.\tCognitive distortions                                                                            4.\tDetection                                                                                              a.\tProQOL                                                                                                b.\tProQOL assessment-activity                                                               c.\tSelf-care inventory                                                                              d.\tEarly warning signals                                                                              e.\tStress factors                                                                                      5.\tIntervention and Self-care                                                                   a.\tSelf-care Assessmentâ€”activity                                                               b.\tEthical self-care requirements                                                             c.\tGuideline for working with challenging clients                                   6.\tPrevention                                                                                              a.\tCompassion satisfaction                                                                      b.\tSelf-care plan                                                                                         c.\tCreate planâ€”activity                                                                            7.\tConclusion                                                                                            a.\tReview</p><p><br/></p>","payBeforeTakingCourse":false,"popularity":0,"rating":0,"numberOfReviews":0,"numberOfContentPages":0,"requireLicenseNumber":null,"requireCertificationNumber":null,"stateId":null,"certificationTypeId":null,"cebCode":null,"providerId":1273,"objectives":null,"isProviderFeatured":true,"completions":0,"totalEarned":0,"isActive":true,"isComplete":false,"isApproved":false,"isPrivate":false,"metaTitle":null,"metaDescription":null,"providerUrl":null,"optimizedUrl":"1884-compassion-fatigue-and","updatedById":null,"certificateConfigId":null,"provider":null,"certificateConfig":null,"certificationType":null,"reviews":null,"students":null,"approvals":null,"professions":null,"subjectAreas":null,"contentPages":null},{"href":null,"id":1705,"name":"NEW!

Military personnel serving in armed conflict face life-threatening situations and the trauma of death and destruction on a daily basis. Repeated exposures over deployments that can last for months can have a detrimental impact on the individualâ€™s mental health. Active duty and former military personnel have higher rates of post-traumatic stress disorder, depression, and suicide than the civilian population. These issues often take a toll on the entire family. Military families, especially when the military member suffers from mental health issues, have a higher rate of domestic violence, child abuse, and divorce.
